  <center><h3>~~~Our origin~~~</h3></center>
  <center><p style="color:black">The founder of Star Sun Pizzeria, Brayden MacMillan, originally was born and raised in Ottawa, Canada, but came to Italy to start a new life here and had a lifelong dream of opening an Italian pizzeria right here, in Positano Italy! Unfortunately, he passed away last year, but he was 97 years old! His legacy will live on forever in this business, and we will always give thanks to him for creating this wonderful community. We have now been at this location for 64 years, since 2040! All of our employees have a passion for crafting top tier Italian pizzas, and we hope to see you on our cliffside padio this summer :)  </p></center>

    <center><h3>Pre-fame</h3></center>
  <center><p>Lana Del Rey was born as Elizabeth Woolridge Grant in New York City on June 21, 1985. Del Rey began drinking regularly as a teenager in the little town of Lake Placid. She had gone to Catholic school, but because of her drinking, her parents sent her to Kent Institution, a boarding school in Connecticut. Although boarding school didn't completely cure her addiction, she was sober by the age of 18. Instead of immediately enrolling in college, she moved to Long Island to live with her aunt and uncle, where her uncle taught her to play the guitar. Despite enrolling at Fordham University in the Bronx to study philosophy, Del Rey's primary passion was music. This is when she started living her truth, and not someone else's.</p></center>

  <center><h3>Albums</h3></center>
  <center><h6>Lana Del Rey has thousands of unreleased songs and albums she never shared with the world, but has 9 albums that have been thoughtfully released to us</h6></center>
